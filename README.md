# Lenovo m93p Hackintosh (OpenCore 6.3)
**(Also, this is my first upload on GitHub lol)**


Works on macOS Big Sur, Catalina, and Mojave. Not tested on Monterey tho.

As many people would say, please don't try this EFI if we don't have the same Processor Specs as it may do more harm than good :)

## Here's mine running Catalina:

## Hardware Specs
- Intel i5-4570
- Intel HD Graphics 4600
- 10GB DDR3 RAM
- Intel Ethernet Drivers 

(WiFi and Bluetooth card seems to be missing in my unit, but I included those kext files incase I bought one)

## So, what's the catch?

Everything seems to work fine. iServices works as well as xCode.

I only have problems with Apple TV as it always crash upon launching the app.
